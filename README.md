# Video_Games_Python
A sample Python project reviewing Video Game Sales

Data highlighting major releases across video game genres (Shooter, Platform, etc.) between 2012-2015. The project includes an exploration of the number of games released and their global sales figures.

*Visualizations:*
 - Bar graph: Average Global Sales by Genre from 2012-2015.
 - Histogram: Global Sales Averages by Genre (including mean and standard deviation lines)

*Functions:*
 - Identify the number of games released in a year that met or exceeded the target global sales number.
 - Compare the number of games released in two separate genres each year between 2012-2015.
 - Generate a histogram displaying average global sales across genres, including a line to identify the location of a target genre.
 - One-sample t-test function that identifies significant effects of the target genre on game sales.

   Function Parameters:
     Genre: Adventure, Action, Strategy, Platform, Role-Playing, Misc, Puzzle, Fighting, Simulation, Shooter, Racing, Sports
     Year: 2012, 2013, 2014, 2015
     DF: games_2012, games_2013, games_2014, games_2015

*Statistical Analysis:*
 - One-sample t-test function was run for each genre identifying significant effects of the genre on game sales. 

It is important to note that this analysis is based on a specific time period and limited data. Generated results are only intended for the practice of statistical concepts.
